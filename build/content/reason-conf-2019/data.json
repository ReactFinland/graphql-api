In 2018, we moved all our frontend development (web and React Native) to ReasonML.\n\nAs a case study about ReasonML in a finished product / client project, we present “Written Order”, a web app for Railway Safety. The app is an intelligent assistant for manual processes in train signalling, helping the signaller to ensure it is safe for the train to proceed.\n\nBased on an interpreter for a check list definition language, it presents the signaller a series of simple questions to guide him/her through complex, deeply context-dependent check lists, generating a filled out “Written Order form” image on the way. The app authenticates against the customer’s Active Directory service and is fully offline-capable, yet still runs in Internet Explorer 11.",

This is a high stakes situation where problems arising of both the human and software variety is ideally zero. Losing a loved one because “undefined is not a function” is certainly not ideal.\n\nIt should not be a surprise that eliminating the occurrence of such software defects in such a high stakes application is of paramount importance. We recently rewrote the core of our first responder stroke triage mobile application in ReasonML and Bucklescript to achieve the necessary safety guarantees that only the ML family of languages can provide.

First responders need to assess patients as accurately and as quickly as possible, and then it's off to the races to the best treatment centre. This is a high stakes situation where problems arising of both the human and software variety is ideally zero. Losing a loved one because “undefined is not a function” is certainly not ideal.\n\nIt should not be a surprise that eliminating the occurrence of such software defects in such a high stakes application is of paramount importance. We recently rewrote the core of our first responder stroke triage mobile application in ReasonML and Bucklescript to achieve the necessary safety guarantees that only the ML family of languages can provide. In this talk, I share details of how we undertook this task and lessons learnt along the way.",

The app is an intelligent assistant for manual processes in train signalling, helping the signaller to ensure it is safe for the train to proceed.\n\nBased on an interpreter for a check list definition language, it presents the signaller a series of simple questions to guide him/her through complex, deeply context-dependent check lists, generating a filled out “Written Order form” image on the way.
