    title: "Building a GraphQL API with node.js",
    description: `Learn how to build a GraphQL API from scratch using Node.js. This workshop is aimed at GraphQL beginners, but you probably have built an API server before. We'll go through the basics of building a GraphQL API server, wrap a REST API with it and then connect it to a database.

The following topics will be covered:

* Basics of GraphQL on a server
* Resolver model
* Ways to define a GraphQL schema
* Schema first design
* Evolving the backing data service, without changing the schema
* Wrapping a REST API with GraphQL gateway
* Connecting to a database

Workshop will have an interactive format, where I will livecode, while explaining what I'm doing. There will also be short presentations and non-coding parts, where I will explain some of the advanced concepts.

At the end of the workshop you should be comfortable building a GraphQL API with node.js.

This workshop is only offered as a bundle deal with a conference.
