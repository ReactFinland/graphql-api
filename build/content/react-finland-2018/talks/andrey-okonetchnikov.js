    description: `No other topic in software development probably has so much controversy as linting. 
  
With a wrong workflow linting can be really a pain and will slow you and your team down. With a proper setup, though, it can save you hours of manual work reformatting the code and reducing the code-review overhead.
  
This talk is a quick introduction into how [ðŸš«ðŸ’© lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) â€” a node.js library I created and maintain â€” can improve developer experience in historically pita field â€” linting. 
  
Coupled with tools that analyze and improve the code like ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier and Jest, you'll witness how much difference can a small tool like this make.`,
