  title: "React Union: Write once, plug anywhere",
  description: `React is usually responsible for managing the render of the whole application. This talk will be about the different use case in which a React application is divided into several standalone configurable modules.

I am going to show how the React modules can be integrated into diverse CMS platforms such as WordPress or Liferay with help of React Union library.

Then we take a look at state management challenges in this kind of setup and how to solve them with @redux-tools.`,
