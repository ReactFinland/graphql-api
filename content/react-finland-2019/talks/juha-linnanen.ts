  title: "CI/CD for React Native",
  description: `Both continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are elements of software development best practices. Setting up CI/CD can be time consuming, even more so for a mobile project. Understanding the basics of how to apply CI/CD practices in React Native mobile application development to automate software release tasks will improve performance and will free up time more usefully spent elsewhere in the project.`,
