However, video that takes a long time to start up leads to frustration and abandonment. The same goes for video that stalls during playback. In this workshop, you’ll learn best practices to optimize the delivery of your video to you customers, ensuring fast delivery and minimizing stalls for a great customer experience.`,

          title: "MicroFrontends in React",
          description: `Our first MicroFrontend project started almost to the day exactly five years ago and since then we have accompanied countless projects following this architectural style. Ever since, the technical possibilities with which MicroFrontends can be implemented have changed significantly and the options have increased considerably.

On the client-side we came from dilettante approaches based on iFrames and settled up with more elaborated strategies like Webpack Module-Federation or EcmaScript Import-Maps. We moved from pure Edge-Side-Includes to full fletched frameworks that allow us to compose MicroFrontends more comfortably and sustainably on the server-side. And even during the implementation, we achieved entirely new possibilities by more mature ways to manage MonoRepos and distributed or incremental builds. By showing real-world examples, we will go into detail about the evolution of these different approaches.
          
Upon a closer look at the challenges that still remain, it will become clear that none of these new concepts and tools come for free but with a fair amount of newly introduced complexity. Ultimately, this workshop will explain the different possibilities to implement MicroFrontends in the past, the present, and the future. More importantly, it will leave you to know which of the available approaches is best suited for your specific task at hand.`,

We'll start with designing a component's API (in a top down approach), then dive deeper to explore how to implement this API, while maintaining a good separation of concerns. 
          
We'll create custom React hooks to implement the Model and React components for the UI. Both expose self-documenting APIs and are completely decoupled from each other.
          
To demo this approach, we'll create a simple Toggler component (a UI component that allows going back and forth in an array of values).
          
Towards the end, we'll explore the benefits, focusing on testing these decoupled units in isolation.`,
