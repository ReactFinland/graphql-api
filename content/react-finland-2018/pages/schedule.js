  intro: `
The schedule of the event has been carefully curated. In true Finnish style, we rather focus on quality than quantity. There is no call for papers and the speakers have been chosen with care.

## 26.04—Thursday—More React

The second day of the event continues where the first one left off:

{schedule:@react-finland/content-2018/src/schedules/26-04-2018}

## 25.04—Wednesday—React

In Finnish style, we start each day early. We also eat lunch early. This way we'll have time to visit sauna, the holiest place of our culture.

The first presentation day has a strict focus on React itself. Each session ends with a brief break and we have a couple longer breaks in between:

{schedule:@react-finland/content-2018/src/schedules/25-04-2018}

There will be fun after the panel.
