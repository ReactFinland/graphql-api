  title: "Real-time GraphQL with Event Sourcing",
  description:
    "GraphQL makes real-time easy with it's Subscriptions support, but how easy is it to build a backend that puts real-time data first?  With event sourcing, it's easier than you think!  The ability to easily subscribe to data changes and have blazing-fast reads on our data sets at Gatsby enables our team to build a sophisticated cloud-native offering that is flexible for even the most demanding product requirements.  Join Andrew as he gives a thirty-thousand foot overview of event sourcing and how naturally it fits with GraphQL and subscriptions.",
